# Type Mismatch Error in TypeScript

This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error: a type mismatch. The function `add` expects two numbers, but a string and a number are passed as arguments.  This results in a type error during compilation.

The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.ts` file shows how to fix this error using type guards or type assertions.
